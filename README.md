# lil-text-editor

Just a lil [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) program to study what it takes to write a text editing widget "from scratch". The current rule for "from scratch" is I can only use the basic rendering operations like "draw this text here" or "draw a rectangle here". You can follow along development here: https://twitter.com/yoshikischmitz/status/1254584810900602881

I'm not great at lua nor am I a particularly adept graphics programmer, so if you have any code suggestions, please feel free to file an issue, PR, or DM me. I would greatly appreciate it!
